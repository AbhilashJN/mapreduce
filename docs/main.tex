\subsection{Goal}
a clear, specific, measurable technical goal you can realistically achieve by the end of the semester;

\subsection{Description}
a description of how your project is novel, different, and/or builds on this prior work (there must be something new about what you do, however minor or incremental; just state it precisely);

\subsection{Outline}
a brief outline of the key technical idea or approach you intend to implement (it is suitable to draw system diagrams, list existing libraries and software you will use, etc.);

\subsection{Measurements}
a set of empirical, quantitative, and/or qualitative metrics you will evaluate your project on, and the methods you will use for your evaluation; and
any foreseen risks that may prevent you from achieving your stated goal.
